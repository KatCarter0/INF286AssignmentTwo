    <p class="bio">I am from a small town north of Louisville, KY. I spent my first two years at NKU focusing on classes about Abrahamic religions and general cultural studies, now I am working towards my computer science minor. My favourite languages I have used are html and css. The first coding language I ever used was VBA in microsoft excel and access. I have made two websites that I am continuously working on, one of which is for the company ChippSoft. Which can be found <a href="https://chippsoft.com/" target="_blank">here</a>. And the other for a local school districts soccer camp. I am not very advanced at web development but I am hoping this class will give me the skillset to move foward into more creative designs. I would also love to learn how to create my own style sheet that I can use with future websites. My biggest challenge so far in web design has been adapting to different screen sizes, so far I have tackled this issue with using overflow and custum scroll bars.</p>
